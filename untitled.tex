After high-school, I try mathematics at university. While the subject was and still is of great interest to me, the amount of work and the rhythm was too fast for me. 
To stay in scientific/technical world but with more hands-on practice, I made an accelerated apprenticeship in computer science and became an IT guy. 
I then moved to a university of applied sciences where I continued to study computer science and got a bachelor in software engineering while working in parallel in a small sport import company providing them with helpdesk support.
In 2005, at the end of my studies, I moved to Finland where I started to work as a research engineer in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences (called Evtek at that time).
