\section{ Development Path as a Teacher, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Challenges, Teacher Idententy and Direction of Development}

I have similarities in my teacher development path and identity as with the ``Case Anne'' as described by Juuti and Raehalme \cite{juuti_2013}. 
As Anne, it has been a long time dream for me to become a teacher. 
Already when I was a kid, since I had ease with math and physics classes and enjoyed to help my classmate, I envisioned to become a math teacher.
And as Anne, when I started teaching, while I was feeling confident with the teaching subjects, I was also spending very much time in preparing the material and spent my weekends and evenings in studying all the content of my courses very deeply.

As Beijaard et al \cite{Beijaard_2004} and Nissila \cite{nissila_2013} state, the teacher identity is dynamic, always becoming and should not be retrospective.
